TwoGo 

TwoGo is a delivery application for users who want to share the cost of a meal without having to pay extra to reach the minimum price.

The application features the following main features:

TwoGo Room tab:
Users can join delivery rooms made by other users or make one themselves. Users can see the food that will be delivered, the time until delivery, the minimum amount of money needed to process the order, the room settings, and the people that want to deliver all at the same time. The host can also customize the rooms to fit their personal preferences and delivery options.

Payment tab:
After ordering a meal, the host is responsible for paying for all of the food ordered. The users who joined that room then sends the money to the host via card or by physical money; if the users send money by card, the process is automatic, and if the users send money through cash, the host manually inputs into the application that they received the money. Users will be locked out from creating or joining any rooms until the money is paid.

History tab:
Users can view previous orders so they can buy from the same restaurant if they want to.

Profile tab:
The user can change various settings including location settings, application settings, and user settings for more control over the application.
