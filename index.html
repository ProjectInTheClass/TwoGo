									<h2>Application Introduction</h2>
									<p>There are many times when a user wants to order something, but has nobody to order with. Due to this, they are forced to pay more than they can eat to satisfy the minimum delivery fee. The TwoGo application is designed to solve this problem.</p>

									<h2>TwoGo tab</h2>
									<p>Users can join delivery rooms made by other users or make one themselves. Users can see the food that will be delivered, the time until delivery, the minimum amount of money needed to process the order, the room settings, and the people that want to deliver all at the same time. The host can also customize the rooms to fit their personal preferences and delivery options.</p>

									<h2>Payment tab</h2>
									<p>After ordering a meal, the host is responsible for paying for all of the food ordered. The users who joined that room then sends the money to the host via card or by physical money; if the users send money by card, the process is automatic, and if the users send money through cash, the host manually inputs into the application that they received the money. Users will be locked out from creating or joining any rooms until the money is paid.</p>
